1. Line 12 prints the current value of i, which is 3 to the console.  The variable i keeps track of the number of iterations of the for loop which is determined by the length of the input array 'prices'.
2. Line 13 prints the value of the variable discountedPrice in the last iteration of the for loop which is i = 2. The value printed is 150 which is returned by the operation 300 * .5.
3. Line 14 prints the value of finalPrice which is 150.  discountedPrice  is multiplied by 100 to get 15000 ,rounded whih does nothing, and divided by 100 to get 150.
4. The function returns the array [50,100,150].  Each element from index i=0-2 is the value of finalPrice for each iteration.  These elements came from the steps described above to get finalPrice for each of the three different input prices. 
5. Error, since i is a let variable declared between the parentheses in the condition, it cannot be accessed outside of the for loop without causing an error.
6. Error, since the variable discountedPrice is declared using the let keyword inside the body of the for loop it cannot be accessed outside the body of the for loop without causing an error.
7. Line 14 prints the value of finalPrice which is 150.  discountedPrice  is multiplied by 100 to get 15000 ,rounded whih does nothing, and divided by 100 to get 150.
8. The function returns the array [50,100,150].  Each element from index i=0-2 is the value of finalPrice for each iteration.  These elements came from the same steps described above to get finalPrice for each of the three different input prices. 
9. Error, since i is a let variable declared between the parentheses in the condition, it cannot be accessed outside of the for loop without causing an error.
10. Line 12 prints the length of the input array which is 3.
11. The function returns the array [50,100,150].  Each element from index i=0-2 is the value of discountedPrice for each iteration.  These elements came from multiplying each of the three different input prices by the input discount.
12. A) student.name
    B) student['Grad Year']
    C) student.greeting()
    D) student['Favorite Teacher'].name

13. A) 32 treated second argument as string and concatenated
    B) 1 treated first argument as int and subtracted
    C) 3 treated null as int 0
    D) 3null treated null as string and concatenated
    E) 4 treated true as int 1
    F) 0 treated false as 0 and null as 0
    G) 3undefined treated undefined as string and concatenated
    H) NaN treated undefined as undefined type
14. A) true treated first argument as int
    B) false treated as strings
    C) true treated second argument as int
    D) false different data types
    E) false treated first argument as int 1
    F) true treated 2 as true
15. == compares ignoring datatype, === compares and checks for same data type
17. [ 2, 4, 6 ] we perform the function doSomething on the array passed into modifyArray which doubles each element of the input array [1,2,3]
